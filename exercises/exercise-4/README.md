# Exercise 4: Let's put it all together to build a Pokemon Detail Page!

At this point, I'm going to be even less descriptive to let you put the rest into place yourself. If you get stuck, feel free to ask questions or look at the code contained in **complete-app-copy**.

## Step 1 - Create a new Route for a Pokemon-specific page in the Stack.

Important additional information:

To add a local search param to a route, use the following syntax `route/[param]`.

[Expo URL Param Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/url-parameters/).

Remember [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/file-based-routing/)!

## Step 2 - Make and fill out the Pokemon Detail page.

Get information about your Pokemon by using the `useGetPokemonQuery` hook.

With a page structure, we can route to other Pokemon's pages directly. The `PokemonEvolutionChain` component co-located with this file uses that - try to use it in your new page!
