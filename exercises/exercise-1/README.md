# Exercise 1: Routing

One of the first steps to Expo development is setting up your routing. We will be using Expo's built in ["file-based routing"](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/file-based-routing/) to add screens to our [Stack](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/stack/).

A Stack is much like it sounds - a "stack" of screens that controls the view. By default, an Index route is shown. When you navigate in a React Native app, the new route "stacks" in front of the index route.

We will be implementing an "About" screen and utilize Expo's built-in Tabs component to navigate.

## Step 1

Add an Index Screen to the stack
